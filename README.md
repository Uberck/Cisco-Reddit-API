# Cisco-Reddit API

This web application is written in HTML, CSS, & JavaScript. We are using JavaScript to access the Reddit JSON object directly and display the results on the user's screen in a nicely-formatted way.

## Installation

Download the ZIP to your desired directory here:

```bash
https://github.com/Uberck/Cisco-Reddit-API/archive/master.zip
```


The site can be hosted locally or remotely using webserver/cloud service of your choice (Apache, IIS, AWS, etc.)
Create a directory where you plan on storing the web application and unzip master.zip's contents to that directory. The website can be launched from here directly as well by double-clicking on index.html (make sure style.css & script.js are in the same directory!)
```
